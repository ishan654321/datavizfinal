- Colab, Kaggle, Jupyter notebook was not helpful when we tried to load 8.6 millions of rows with 1.1 GB size of csv file into data frame. 
The visualizations were taking even longer time to generate.
- The dataset lacks the event descriptions like hurricane or storm passing area and how affected the area was.
- The dataset is also between limited years 2016 to 2022 which could be insufficient to predict climate change or any such changes.
